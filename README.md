 
# Computer Vision Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated my learning and experimenting with computer vision techniques. 

## Project Structure
- `datasets/`: Stores or links to datasets used for experiments.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step tutorials and experiments.
- `src/`: Core scripts and utilities for various computer vision tasks.
- `experiments/`: Save experiment settings, results, and notes.

## Topics Covered
1. **Image Processing**: Basics of OpenCV, edge detection, filtering, etc.
2. **Feature Extraction**: SIFT, ORB, HOG descriptors.
3. **Deep Learning Models**: CNNs, object detection models, etc.
4. **Advanced Topics**: Segmentation, motion detection.
